                      In today's world, soil pollution is an undeniable
                      challenge. Some 150 million tons of municipal solid waste
                      is landfilled in the U.S. every year. What is more
                      surprising is that some do not take this issue seriously,
                      often burying trash without a second thought. This
                      behavior contributes to the misconception that soil
                      contamination is not serious because it is not immediately
                      visible. In reality, soil pollution has far-reaching
                      consequences for the entire ecosystem, affecting plant
                      growth, water quality, and human health. As we strive for
                      sustainable solutions, one promising avenue lies in the
                      remarkable abilities of microbes to degrade soil waste. As
                      I aspire to become a microbiologist, I envision a future
                      where these tiny organisms play a critical role in
                      restoring the health of our soil, which will be achieved
                      through innovative ESG solutions. Specifically, my goal is
                      to integrate scientific advancements with ethical
                      practices to address soil pollution and create a
                      sustainable future for our healthy society. <br />
                      First and foremost, I will focus on microbial
                      bioremediation as a microbial approach to environmental
                      conservation, which is a significant aspect of the
                      'environment' in ESG practice. In fact, microorganisms can
                      be deployed to facilitate the breakdown of organic
                      compounds and contaminants in soil through mechanisms such
                      as biodegradation. In turn, biodegradation processes
                      convert complex pollutants to innocuous products, thus
                      cleaning the soil. Here, genetically enhanced
                      microorganisms can be developed and deployed to further
                      enhance the innate capabilities of microorganisms for
                      sustainable pollution remediation of soil. For instance,
                      certain bacteria strains can be engineered to remove heavy
                      metals or persistent organic pollutants from contaminated
                      soil to make it habitable and productive for any
                      subsequent use. Research in this field is emerging with
                      the deployment of genetically engineered bacteria capable
                      of degrading plastics and other persistent bio-pollutants.
                      Plastics are a major pollutant of soil, and their release
                      into the environment could have detrimental long-term
                      impacts. It is our primary responsibility to abate this
                      compound and green it. Thus, engineered bacteria capable
                      of synthesizing plastic polymer-degrading enzymes will
                      facilitate the biodegradation of plastics, thereby
                      preventing their build-up in the soil. At the same time,
                      microbial bioremediation will also aid social equity by
                      promoting human and environmental health in communities
                      where soil pollution has adverse social impacts.<br />
                      Additionally, soil pollution has a disproportionate impact
                      on vulnerable populations who often reside in polluted
                      areas created by industrial operations and poor waste
                      disposal practices. Microbial cleanup of polluted soil
                      will thus promote social equity as a component of ESG
                      practices. As a matter of fact, pure soil promotes healthy
                      plant growth, reduces exposure to toxic pollutants, and
                      generally improves community well-being. Furthermore,
                      local community participation in bioremediation efforts
                      will generate training and employment opportunities, thus
                      creating a sense of belonging and empowerment. In
                      addition, I envision a world where local communities take
                      the lead in soil health and bioremediation initiatives. To
                      do so, I believe community residents can be trained to act
                      as soil health monitors and manage the bioremediation
                      efforts, thereby creating employment opportunities and
                      spreading awareness of the need for environmental
                      conservation. This ensures that the benefits of clean soil
                      go beyond the environment to address its social aspects.
                      Training regimes can further be developed to enlighten
                      residents on soil health, the role of microbes in
                      bioremediation, and how they can actively participate in
                      sustaining a clean environment. Concurrently, clean soil
                      efforts can be dovetailed with local agricultural systems
                      to encourage sustainable agricultural practices that
                      improve soil health and plant harvests. Local farmers are
                      the best-known custodians of their local environment and
                      can develop bioremediation strategies that are harmonious
                      with prevailing agricultural systems and whose adoption to
                      achieve clean soil is realistic and beneficial to the
                      community. The development of clean soil bioremediation
                      strategies will promote a community that is safer and
                      healthier with an environmentally friendly habitat. Clean
                      soil also contributes to food security and sustainable
                      environmental stewardship. <br />
                      Moreover, technology can also be an important tool to
                      apply the latest scientific findings to soil pollution.
                      One of the peculiar applications is the use of synthetic
                      biology to develop custom-made microbes with improved
                      bioremediation capacities. Synthetic biology creates new
                      biological systems and, therefore, allows us to redesign
                      the existing natural biological systems for
                      technologically useful purposes. Specifically, we can use
                      synthetic biology to engineer microbes with desired traits
                      that enhance their activity to degrade pollutants. For
                      instance, technology can create bacteria that overproduce
                      enzymes to degrade toxic chemicals or bacteria that can
                      thrive in extreme environmental conditions where naturally
                      occurring microbes may not. <br />
                      Furthermore, we can utilize metagenomics to study the
                      complex microbial communities of microbes in soil. In
                      fact, metagenomics analyses genetic material that is
                      recovered from soil samples, and therefore, we can
                      characterize diverse, contaminated soils. By gathering
                      such information, we can effectively create a solution
                      that deals with soil contamination and enhance the
                      effectiveness of remediation efforts. These technological
                      advancements are indeed happening and can possibly be in
                      practical use in the near future, and we can then address
                      the challenges presented by different types of soil
                      pollution. <br />
                      Last but not least, robust governance is essential for the
                      success of any ESG initiative, including those aimed at
                      addressing soil pollution. As an aspiring microbiologist,
                      I will advocate for specific policies that support the use
                      of microbial bioremediation and other sustainable
                      practices. This will also involve working with government
                      agencies, non-profit organizations, and private sector
                      companies to create the regulations and incentives that
                      will steer environmental sustainability. For instance,
                      policies that compel industries to monitor and remedy
                      their soil pollution through bioremediation technologies
                      can spur tremendous environmental gains. By pushing for
                      these policies, we can ensure that the use of microbial
                      bioremediation is encouraged and regulated safely and
                      responsibly. <br />
                      To do so, transparent reporting and accountability
                      measures are vital to ensure that these policies are well
                      maintained and put into effect. One way to do this is to
                      establish standards for soil health, assess the efficacy
                      of bioremediation efforts, and fund research and
                      development of new microbial technologies. Lastly, soil
                      contamination is not confined to national borders, and
                      pollutants can easily spread through air and water,
                      affecting multiple regions. Thus, it is necessary for
                      nations to cooperate on a global scale and hence develop
                      global strategies for soil remediation and share knowledge
                      and resources to ensure all countries have access to the
                      tools and technologies needed to combat soil pollution.
                      <br />
                      To conclude, soil pollution demands urgent action, and I
                      have written that the power of microbes offers a promising
                      solution. As a future microbiologist, I am dedicated to
                      structuring microbial processes and developing innovative
                      strategies to solve soil contamination. Through effective
                      environmental practices such as microbial bioremediation,
                      synthetic biology, and metagenomics, we can create a
                      healthier environment where the soil thrives and future
                      generations can flourish. To do so, we must also build
                      robust governance and social policies that can catalyze
                      our environmental effect - which can be done through
                      establishing regulations, providing incentives, global
                      cooperation, and sharing accessible tools and technology.
                      Therefore, by prioritizing ESG practice, we can create a
                      sustainable future and secure a better quality of life for
                      all. <br />
